## Some notes

### Norbert Winer Process

0. $W_0=0$
0. $W$ has independent increments: for every $t > 0$ the future increments $W_{t + u} âˆ’ W_t$, $u \geq 0$ are independent of the past values $W_s$, $s\leq t$.
0. $W$ has Gaussian increments: $W_{t+u}-W_{t}$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $u$ $W_{t+u}-W_{t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,u)$.
0. $W$ has continuous paths: $W_{t}$ is continuous in $t$.
